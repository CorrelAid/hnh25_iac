You will receive an email to the address you provided when you registered for the hackathon. This email will be sent from mail@correlaid.de and will contain a link to verify your account. To avoid posting information that you do not want to make public, your public username has been set to a random string of characters. You can update your username in your [profile](https://hack.correlaid.org/user/profile). While you can always log in with your e-mail address only, you can also set a password there.
